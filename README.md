# USAGE
### Set the channel variable to your Youtube Channel ID. Get this by going to studio.youtube.com/channel - the text that follows it ("ABCDakjhasdlfjkhaskjdhJJ39234Qb") is what you use.
### Set the name of the file you want for the output. 
### Specify a whitelist of domains that you want to filter out. For example, amzn.to will filter out affiliate links. Put domains you wish to filter out on a separate line.
### Run the script "python YTLinkChecker.py".
### Open up the CSV file to view links.
